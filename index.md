[Stan](http://mc-stan.org) is a modern, high performance probabilistic programming language for Bayesian inference. Stan was developed to help statisticians fit models that were impossible to fit with other tools: models that contain hundreds of thousands of parameters, arbitrarily complex likelihood functions, and many levels of hierarchy. 

Stan is used for fitting climate models, clinical drug trials, genomics and cancer biology, population dynamics, psycholinguistics, social networks, finance and econometrics, professional sports, publishing, recommender systems, educational testing, and many more.

We formed Stan Group to help companies and individuals adopt Stan for their analytical work. 

### Stan Group's Focus
* 1-3 day Stan and Bayesian training courses
* Stan statistical support subscription
* Custom model development and deployment
* Building tools that make Stan easier to use for individuals and large companies
