[Stan](http://mc-stan.org) is a modern, high performance probabilistic programming language for Bayesian inference. Stan was developed to help statisticians fit models that were impossible to fit with other tools: models that contain hundreds of thousands of parameters, arbitrarily complex likelihood functions, and many levels of hierarchy. 

Today Stan is used for fitting climate models, clinical drug trials, genomics and cancer biology, population dynamics, psycholinguistics, social networks, finance and econometrics, professional sports, publishing, recommender systems, educational testing, and many more.

We formed Stan Group to help with commercial and individual adoption of Stan. We are Stan developers and entrepreneurs whose goal is to spread the joy of state of the art Bayesian computing to the masses.
